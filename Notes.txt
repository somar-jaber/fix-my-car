router.get("/", authMiddleware.authMiddleware, asyncTryCatch(async(req, res) => {
    // this will only show the user's branch inside the car's branches field
    let cars = await CarModel.find().populate({
        path: 'branches',
        model: 'Branch', // if the model is not in the same file we need to mention it in the "model" filed
        match: { _id: req.user.branch }
    });

    // this will exclude the cars which didn't visit the user's branch
    cars = cars.filter(car => car.branches.length != 0 );

    return res.send(cars);
}));

// but what we want for the user is to see the car's visited branches if it is already visited his branch
// so for that we must use :
/*
    // if the car didn't visit the user branch so they are not allowed to see its info
    if (!carSample.branches.includes(req.user.branch))
        return res.stauts(400).send("400 Bad Request: You are not allowed to see this car's info");
    // other wise they can see all the info
*/
